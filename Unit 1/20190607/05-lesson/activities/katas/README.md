* Write some methods

## List of Katas

1. Add the code necessary to the `App` class found in the `starter-code` project `U1M1L5Katas`.
1. The requirements for each method are listed below.


    - **Subtract Two**: Create a method called `subtract` that takes two int parameters (a and b) and returns the value of b subtracted from a.
    - **Subtract or Zero**: Create a method called `subtractOrZero` that takes two int parameters (a and b) and returns the value of b subtracted from a, unless the result is less than zero, in which case, return 0.
    - **Max**: Create a method called `max` that takes three int parameters (a, b, and c) and returns the value of the largest of the three.
    - **Min**: Create a method called `min` that takes three int parameters (a, b, and c) and returns the value of the smallest of the three.
    - **isLarger**: Create a method called `isLarger` that takes two int parameters (first and second) and returns true if the first is greater than second.
